# Welcome to WorkTree

WorkTree is a project planning and analysis tool supporting the Critical Path Method (CPM), the Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) as well as the Integrated Master Plan/Integrated Master Schedule (IMP/IMS) concept. It also integrates an outliner with cross-link capabilities, Lua scripting and a full text database with built-in search engine.

Even if the tool was already of use in large projects it is still considered work in progress by its author. Especially the scheduling algorighm, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Organization Breakdown Structure (OBS) and ressource management features need more work. But it is already possible to import Microsoft Project schedules (on Windows), do PDM modelling and analysis and calculate Earned Value Management (EVM) and schedule health metrics using Lua scripts.

Here a selection of relevant literature the tool is based on:

* Oâ€™Brien, J.; Plotnick, F. (2006): CPM in Construction Management, 6th edition; McGraw-Hill
* Humphreys, G. (2011): Project Management Using Earned Value, 2nd edition; Humphreys & Assoc.
* Program Management Systems Committee (2012): Planning & Scheduling Excellence Guide (PASEG), 2nd edition; National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA)
* PAM 200.1 (2012): Earned Value Management System (EVMS) Program Analysis Pamphlet (PAP); U.S. DoD Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)

## Download and Installation

You can either compile WorkTree yourself or download
the pre-compiled version from here: 

http://software.rochus-keller.info/WorkTree_win32.zip

http://software.rochus-keller.info/WorkTree_linux_x86.tar.gz

This is a compressed single-file executable which was built using the source code from here. You can also build the executable yourself if you want (see below for instructions). Since it is a single executable, it can just be downloaded and unpacked. No installation is necessary. You therefore need no special privileges to run WorkTree on your machine. 

Here is a demo file with some instructions on how to use WorkTree: http://software.rochus-keller.info/WorkTreeDemo.wtdb

## How to Build WorkTree

### Preconditions
WorkTree was originally developed using Qt4.x. The single-file executables are static builds based on Qt 4.4.3. But it compiles also well with the Qt 4.8 series; the current version is not yet compatible with Qt 5.x, but migration should be straight forward. 

You can download the Qt 4.4.3 source tree from here: http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.4/qt-all-opensource-src-4.4.3.tar.gz

The source tree also includes documentation and build instructions.

If you intend to do static builds on Windows without dependency on C++ runtime libs and manifest complications, follow the recommendations in this post: http://www.archivum.info/qt-interest@trolltech.com/2007-02/00039/Fed-up-with-Windows-runtime-DLLs-and-manifest-files-Here's-a-solution.html

Here is the summary on how to do implement Qt Win32 static builds:
1. in Qt/mkspecs/win32-msvc2005/qmake.conf replace MD with MT and MDd with MTd
2. in Qt/mkspecs/features clear the content of the two embed_manifest_*.prf files (but don't delete the files)
3. run configure -release -static -platform win32-msvc2005

To use Qt with WorkTree you have to make the following modification: QTreeView::indexRowSizeHint has to be virtual; the correspondig line in qtreeview.h should look like:
    virtual int indexRowSizeHint(const QModelIndex &index) const;

### Build Steps
Follow these steps if you inted to build WorkTree yourself (don't forget to meet the preconditions before you start):

1. Create a directory; let's call it BUILD_DIR
2. Download the WorkTree source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/WorkTree/archive/master.zip and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename the subdirectory to "WorkTree".
3. Download the Stream source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Stream/archive/github.zip and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename "Stream-github" to "Stream".
4. Download the Udb source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Udb and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename "Udb-github" to "Udb".
5. Create the subdirectory "Sqlite3" in BUILD_DIR; download the Sqlite source from http://software.rochus-keller.info/Sqlite3.tar.gz and unpack it to the subdirectory.
6. Download the Txt source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Txt and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename "Txt-github" to "Txt".
7. Download the Oln2 source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oln2 and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename "Oln2-github" to "Oln2".
8. Download the NAF source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/NAF/archive/master.zip and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename "NAF-Master" to "NAF". We only need the Gui2, Script, Script2 and Qtl2 subdirectory so you can delete all other stuff in the NAF directory.
9. Create the subdirectory "Lua" in BUILD_DIR; download the modified Lua source from http://cara.nmr-software.org/download/Lua_5.1.5_CARA_modified.tar.gz and unpack it to the subdirectory.
10. Download the CrossLine source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/CrossLine/archive/master.zip and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename the subdirectory to "CrossLine"; we only need the files DocSelector.* and DocTabWidget.*.
11. Download the QtSingleApplication source files from https://github.com/qtproject/qt-solutions/tree/master/qtsingleapplication/src and copy them to BUILD_DIR/QtApp directory together with this file: http://software.rochus-keller.info/QtApp.pri
12. Goto the BUILD_DIR/WorkTree subdirectory and execute `QTDIR/bin/qmake WorkTree.pro` (see the Qt documentation concerning QTDIR).
13. Run make; after a couple of minutes you will find the executable in the tmp subdirectory.

Alternatively you can open WorkTree.pro using QtCreator and build it there.
